ETL based on Django model introspection.

Django-etl-sync derives ETL rules from Django model introspection and is able to trace and create relationships such as foreign keys and many-to-many relationship.

The package currently lacks a method to move records no longer present in upstream data.


Overview
--------

- Re-usable Django app that provides classes for light weight ETL in your project. (Will be more independent from the Django framework in the future)

- Geared toward sync'ing with upstream data sources (e.g. for an API) or legacy data (it was originally build for ecoengine.berkeley.edu loading million records from museum collection data with regular small changes).

- Prioritizes data consistency over speed.

- Subclassing allows for replacing of methods with speedier, simplified or more sophisticated versions.

- Supports data persistence, consistency, normalization, and recreation of relationships from flatten files or dumps.

- Derives ETL rules from Django model introspection (the use of other frameworks or database declarations is planned). This rules can be easily modified and overriden (as long as they do not cause integrity errors).

- Can be easily used within a parallelization framework such as Celery, thorough checks of the state of the destination avoid race conditions and inconsistencies (at the cost of speed.)

- Supports Django Forms as transformation rules. This way web forms within the app can be re-used as transformation rules.

Requirements
------------

- Python 2.7 upwards, Python 3
- Django 1.7 (tested) upwards
- GDAL if OGR readers for geodata are used

Installation
------------

The package is in active development toward a release. For evaluation, contribution, and testing.

.. code-block:: sh
    pip install -e git+ssh://git@github.com/postfalk/django-etl-sync#egg=django-etl-sync

Add `etl_sync` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py.

Minimal Examples
----------------

The module provides two principal ways of usage on either file or record level.

1. Use the ``Loader`` class to specify all ETL operations. If you need to make changes to the data between reading from the file and writing them to the database create a custom ``Transformer`` class (see below).

**The loader class was called Mapper in earlier versions. There is still a* ``Mapper`` *class which is a wrapper of the* ``Loader`` *class that will throw an deprecation warning upon initialization (removal planned for version 1.0). Applications that were build with the older version will still work for now.*

2. Use the ``Generator`` class to generate a Django model instance from a dictionary and return the instance. The input dictionary needs to satisfy the the requirements of the model. Apply transformations beforehand.

The difference to simply create an instance by Model(**dict) is the thorough check for consistency and the creation of relationships. However, if the simple method is convenient, a Django Model could be used in place of the Generator.

Minimal example: file load
--------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # data.txt
    record  name
    1 one
    2 two
    3 three


    # main.py
    from django.db import models
    from etl_sync.loaders import Loader

    class TestModel(models.Model):
        """
        Example Model.
        """
        record = models.CharField(max_length=10)
        name = models.CharField(max_length=10, null=True, blank=True)


    class YourLoader(Loader):
        """
        Add your specific settings here.
        """
        filename = 'data.txt'
        model_class = TestModel


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        loader = YourLoader()
        res = loader.load()


Minimal example: dictionary load
--------------------------------

.. code-block:: python

    # main.py
    from etl_sync.generators import BaseInstanceGenerator
    from <yourproject>.models import TestModel

    dic = {'record': 3, 'name': 'three'}

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        # add additional transformations here
        generator = BaseInstanceGenerator(TestModel, dic)
        instance = generator.get_instance()
        print(instance, generator.res)


Persistence
-----------

**Unique fields**

Before loading a record it might be necessary to check whether it already exists, whether it needs to be added or updated (persistence). By default the module inspects the target model and uses model fields with the attribute unique=True as criterion for persistence. The module will check first whether any record with the given combination of values in unique fields already exists and update that record.

.. note:: Do not use the models internal pk or 
id field as identifier for your data! Add an extra record or 
remote_id field.

**Extra arguments**

Another method to add (or overwrite) persistence criterions is to add a 
a list of fields via key word argument.

... code-block:: python

    generator = InstanceGenerator(TestModel, dic, persistence = ['record', 'source'])


**Subclassing**

You can subclass InstanceGenerator to create your own generator class.

... code-bock:: python

    from etl_sync.generators import InstanceGenerator

    class MyGenerator(InstanceGenerator):
        """
        My generator class with custom persistence criterion.
        """
        persistence = ['record', 'source']


**etl_persistence key in data dictionary**

The last method is to put an extra key value pair in your data dictionary.

... code-block:: python

    dic = {'record': 6365, 'name': 'john', 'occupation': 'developer', 'etl_persistence': ['record']}


This technique is useful for nested records if the recursive call of
InstanceGenerator cannot be
directly accessed (see below). However ...

**Defining persistence by a field attributes and a concise data model is the 
preferred method.**

Once the variable **persistence** is overwritten the model field attributes 
will be ignored. Nevertheless, conflicts with your data definition will 
through database errors. 

Error handling
--------------

If the Generator class is called within the Mapper class, errors will
be caught and written to the defined logfile or to stdout. But the 
loading process will continue. 

Readers
-------

By default django-etl-sync uses the csv.DictReader, other reader 
classes can be used or created if they are similar to csv.DictReader.

The package currently contains a reader for OGR readable files.

.. code-block:: python

    from etl_sync.generators import InstanceGenerator
    from etl_sync.readers import OGRReader

    class MyMapper(Mapper):
        reader_class=OGRReader


*The* ``OGRReader`` *covers the functionality of the older* ``ShapefileReader``*.
There is still a stub class called ``ShapefileReader`` for compatibility.
It will be removed in version 1.0.*

Transformations
---------------

Transformations remap the dictionary from the CSV reader or
another reader class to the Django model. We attempt to map the
dictionary key to the model field with the matching name.
The transformer classes allow for remapping and validation of incoming
records.

Instantiate InstanceGenerator with a costumized Transformer class:

.. code-block: python

    from etl_sync.loaders import Loader
    from etl_sync.transformes import Transformer

    class MyTransformer(Transformer):
        mappings = {'id': 'record', 'name': 'last_name'}
        defaults = {'last_name': 'Doe'}
        forms = []
        blacklist = {'last_name': ['NA', r'unknown']}

    class MyMapper(InstanceGenerator):
        model_class = {destination model}
        transformer_class = MyTransformer
        filename = myfile.txt

    loader = MyLoader()
    loader.load()

* The `mapping` property contains a dictionary in the form `{‘original_fieldname’: ‘new_fieldname’}` which will remap the dictionary.
* The `defaults` property holds a dictionary that gets applied if the value for the dictionary key in question is empty.
* The `forms` property holds a list of Django forms that get applied to the dictionary. WARNING: old values will not be removed. The cleaned_data keys will be added to the dictionary.
* And finally the `blacklist` property holds a list of values for a particular key that will trigger a validation error. The record will be discarded.

WARNING: These methods will be applied in exactly that order. If the dictionary changes in one of these steps, the next step needs to take these changes into consideration.

In addition to these built-in transformations, there are two additional methods that can be modified for more thorough changes:

.. code-block:: python

    class MyTransformer(Transformer):

        def transform(self, dic):
            """Make whatever changes needed here."""
            return dic

        def validate(self, dic):
            """Raise ValidationErrors"""
            if last_name == 'Bunny':
                raise ValidationError('I do not want to have this record')

Both methods will be applied after the forementioned built-in methods.


Django form support
-------------------

Django-etl-sync fully support Django forms. You can reuse the Django forms from your
project to bulk load data. See section “Transformations”.


Create transformer for related models
-------------------------------------

Alternative strategies for loading normalized or related data
-------------------------------------------------------------

Table dumps of related tables
-----------------------------

Creating related tables from same data source
---------------------------------------------

File load
---------

Loging
------

Django-etl-sync will create a log file in the same location as the source file.
It will contain the list of rejected records.

.. code-block: sh
    source_file.txt
    source_file.txt.2014-07-23.log

Roadmap
-------

- Create readers for more source types, especially for comma limited data, and headerless CSV.
- Add a way for data removal, if deleted from source.
